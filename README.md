# My Private Projects Repository

## About This Repository
Welcome to my private project repository! This space contains a collection of my personal projects where I experiment with various languages, libraries, and frameworks. Here, I’m focused on building a strong foundation in **Rust**, **Java**, and **Python** while exploring areas like APIs, web development, and backend services.

## What's Inside
Here’s an overview of the types of projects you’ll find in this repository:

- **Spotify API Integrations (Rust)**: Projects using the Spotify API to manage playlists, retrieve song information, and experiment with media-related data, all implemented with Rust’s strong type system and performance capabilities.
  
- **Simple HTTP Servers (Rust)**: Lightweight HTTP servers built in Rust to explore backend principles, handling requests, routing, and serving basic web content. These projects help me practice server-side logic, RESTful patterns, and concurrency.
  
- **Java Projects**: A variety of projects in Java covering object-oriented design, algorithms, and basic data processing. Java has been a core part of my studies, and I’m expanding my skills by creating small-scale applications and utilities.
  
- **Python Projects**: Python scripts and projects that range from data analysis to scripting automation. Python is my go-to language for quick prototyping, data handling, and machine learning explorations.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Rust**: Mastering ownership, concurrency, and memory management through API interactions and server-side development.
- **Java**: Focusing on object-oriented principles, design patterns, and larger application structures.
- **Python**: Data manipulation, machine learning (e.g., with Pandas, NumPy), and scripting for automation tasks.
- **APIs**: Spotify API, RESTful principles, and integration with web services.
  
## Goals
- **Learn and Experiment**: Develop skills by working on real-world projects using Rust, Java, and Python.
- **Deepen Backend Knowledge**: Gain hands-on experience with server implementation, API integration, and backend development.
- **Apply Best Practices**: Practice clean code, modularization, and effective debugging strategies in each language.

## Notes
Since these projects contain sensitive API keys and experimental code, this repository is private. If you’re interested in specific details or have any questions, feel free to reach out!
